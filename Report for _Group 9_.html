    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
    <p><strong>Pluses: </strong>Over all the website looks quite nice, and we spend lots of time on the structure to make it good.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong>We do not have much teamwork for the project, everyone did the work on their own, and we combined those things together afterwards.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong>We found many interesting stories about ice-cream shops during our research, and we gained lots of knowledge about how to open an ice-crean cafe after we finished this project.</p>
