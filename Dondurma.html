<h1>NEW CHILLS FOR SUMMER - Dondurma</h1>
				  <span>  - Ice-cream Cafe</span>
			    <p>Singapore is also where you can find ice cream varieties from all over the world. Dondurma is Turkish ice cream that is stickier and stretchier than most commercial ice cream – and is often prepared with a great deal of visual spectacle at street stalls. Then there's the Indian kulfi, found in the dessert section of most Indian restaurants and in a couple of specialist kulfi bars, made with cream, cornstarch and spices – and available in flavours ranging from pistachio and vanilla to Baileys and rose. If you're after something lighter and softer, try some Hokkaido ice cream, typically sold at specialty ice cream cafés and at stalls in shopping malls.

					<p>A popular form is a three-layer cake, with a layer of ice cream between two layers of cake, although not all versions contain cake. ... Whipped cream is often used for frosting, as a compliment to the two other textures, and because many typical frostings will not adhere successfully to frozen cake.</p>
